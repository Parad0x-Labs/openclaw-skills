/**
 * BYO-signer payment construction.
 *
 * The skill builds a fully-formed but UNSIGNED Solana transaction, hands it to
 * the agent owner's `X402Signer.signTransaction` (a wallet adapter / hardware
 * signer / KMS the owner controls), then broadcasts the returned signed bytes.
 * At no point does this module hold, request, or read a private key.
 *
 * Dependencies: @solana/web3.js + bs58 (both pure-JS, widely used) and Node's
 * built-in crypto. The three SPL Token instruction builders are vendored in
 * ./spl (byte-identical to @solana/spl-token, proven in the wire tests) so the
 * package does not pull the unmaintained native bigint-buffer addon. No
 * @parad0x_labs/* runtime dependency.

 * Build the unsigned USDC payment transaction for a 402 requirement.

 * The tx carries TWO transfer legs in one atomic unit:
 *   1. the seller leg — the checked USDC transfer of `req.maxAmountRequired` to payTo;
 *   2. the protocol-fee leg — a checked USDC transfer of the pinned 5 bps fee to the
 *      protocol treasury (a Squads multisig), settled directly on-chain.
 * Each leg is preceded by an idempotent ATA-create (so a fresh recipient/treasury
 * account never fails the pay), and a single memo carries the receipt hash.
 *
 * Because both legs share one atomic tx, the buyer CANNOT pay the seller without also
 * paying the fee: either both settle or neither does. The fee amount and treasury are
 * pinned LOCALLY (PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS / PROTOCOL_FEE_TREASURY) and never read from the
 * untrusted challenge — a greedy seller can't zero the fee, nor a malicious challenge
 * redirect it. The gate enforces the matching fee leg at settlement (confirmOnChain).
 *
 * WARNING: UNGUARDED low-level builder. It does NOT enforce the spend cap, mainnet
 * opt-in, USDC-only asset, recipient allowlist, or distinct-recipient cap — all of
 * those live in selectRequirement()/fetchWithX402(). It also assumes USDC's 6
 * decimals for the (unchecked) req.asset. Drive payments through fetchWithX402; use
 * this directly only if you re-assert those invariants yourself first.
