# openclaw-x402-gate — charge other agents with x402 on Solana

> **Install on a wallet host with `npm install --ignore-scripts`** (or `--omit=optional`).
> This package runs where your seller key lives; `--ignore-scripts` blocks any
> transitive install-time code. The only native addons are optional and unused here,
> so nothing is lost. npm can't enforce this from inside a package — it's on you.

Turn any OpenClaw skill or API into a paid endpoint. Mint an HTTP **402 Payment
Required** challenge, verify the payment, then serve. Funds settle **straight to
your own wallet** on Solana — the skill holds no keys and takes no custody. Pairs
with [`x402-pay`](../x402-pay)
(the paying side) for the full agent-to-agent loop on a rail that runs on
Solana mainnet-beta (public beta; devnet by default for testing).

## Trust model

- **No custody.** `recipientAddress` is *your* public wallet; payments land there
  on-chain. This skill signs nothing and holds no keys.
- **Stateless.** Both tools reconstruct the same requirement from config +
  resource, so receipt hashes match the paying side with no shared state.
- **Revenue-grade option.** Set `requireOnChain: true` and a payment is accepted
  only after its transaction is **confirmed settled on Solana** — not just a
  well-formed header. The check binds to the unique receipt hash in the tx memo,
  so proofs can't be replayed against a different charge.
- **Protocol fee (client-verified).** Every settled payment carries a **0.05% (5 bps)**
  protocol-fee leg to the protocol treasury (a Squads multisig) in the *same atomic
  transaction* as your seller payment. `requireOnChain` verifies both legs and refuses to
  serve if the fee is missing or short — fail-closed on the gating side. This is a
  client-side on-chain check, not a program-enforced split. The fee amount and treasury are pinned in code on both the paying and
  gating sides, never read from the challenge, so it can't be zeroed or redirected. Still
  non-custodial: the fee settles directly on-chain, no one holds it.

> **Non-custodial.** Payments settle straight to your own wallet (less the pinned
> 0.05% protocol fee, which settles directly to the treasury); the skill holds no

## Standalone or together

Part of [openclaw-skills](https://github.com/Parad0x-Labs/openclaw-skills).
Every skill there is a self-contained module — no imports from sibling skills,
own version, own CI lane — so installing, updating, or removing one never
breaks another.

- **Standalone:** yes — this is the *selling* side; any x402-compliant client
  can pay your gate, not just our skill.
- **Pairs with:** [`x402-pay`](../x402-pay) on the *buying* agent for the full
  loop (matching receipt hashes, no shared state). Optional:
  [`context-capsule`](../context-capsule) to keep long selling sessions cheap.

## The two tools

```
x402_challenge({ resource, description? })
  → { status: 402, body }          // send `body` to an unpaid caller

x402_verify({ header, resource })
  → { valid, payerAddress, amountUsdc, receiptHash, onChainVerified, capability? }
```

## Config

```jsonc
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "x402-gate": {
        "recipientAddress": "YOUR_SOLANA_WALLET",      // required — where funds land
        "priceUsdc": 0.05,
        "network": "solana-mainnet",                    // default
        "challengeSecret": "<random 32+ char secret>",  // REQUIRED on mainnet
        "replayStorePath": "/var/lib/x402/replay.log",  // REQUIRED on mainnet (durable, single-instance)
        "acknowledgeSingleInstance": true,              // confirm you run ONE instance
        "rpcUrl": "https://<your-private-rpc>"          // recommended on mainnet
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `recipientAddress` | — (required) | Your wallet; payments settle here. Public key only. |
| `priceUsdc` | `0.01` | Default price per request (USDC) |
| `network` | `solana-mainnet` | Settlement network. Set `solana-devnet` to test |
| `requireOnChain` | `true` | Confirm settlement before serving. **Refused on mainnet if `false`** (header-only mode is devnet/testing only) |
| `dedupe` | `true` | Single-use payment guard. On mainnet needs a durable store (below) |
| `replayStorePath` | — | Restart-durable, **single-instance** replay store path. Required on mainnet with `dedupe` |
| `acknowledgeSingleInstance` | `false` | Attest you run ONE instance (the file store isn't shared across replicas). Required on mainnet with `dedupe` |
| `acknowledgeExternalReplayStore` | `false` | Attest you run your own shared store. Required on mainnet with `dedupe: false` |
| `requirePresenterAuth` | `true` | Caller signs the nonce with the payer key. **Forced on for mainnet** |
| `challengeSecret` | — | MACs nonces + capability tokens. **Required on mainnet** |
| `receiptScopeSeconds` | `0` | >0 issues a reusable capability token (pay once, reuse within scope) |
| `rpcUrl` | — | Solana RPC for settlement checks. Use a private node on mainnet |

> **Mainnet is fail-closed.** On `solana-mainnet` the gate refuses to serve (every
> call returns an error) unless: `requireOnChain` is true; replay is durable
> (`replayStorePath` + `acknowledgeSingleInstance`, or `dedupe: false` +
> `acknowledgeExternalReplayStore` with your own shared store); a `challengeSecret`
> and an explicit `rpcUrl` are set. Header-only mode (`requireOnChain: false`) is
> allowed only on devnet.

### Scaling: single instance vs. multiple replicas

The built-in replay store (`replayStorePath` → `FileReplayStore`) is **per-instance**:
it lives on one process's disk and is **not shared across replicas**. Running two
copies against the same path would let one settled payment be redeemed once *per
replica*. To prevent that, `FileReplayStore` takes a **single-instance lock** on
startup — a second instance pointed at the same path **refuses to start**.

- **Single instance (default):** set `replayStorePath` + `acknowledgeSingleInstance: true`. Done.
- **Multiple replicas / load-balanced:** do **not** use `replayStorePath`. Set
  `dedupe: false` + `acknowledgeExternalReplayStore: true` and enforce replay in
  your own **shared atomic store** (Redis `SETNX` / a DB unique constraint) around
  the returned `signature`/`receiptHash` before serving.

> **Capabilities (`receiptScopeSeconds > 0`) are single-instance only** — they
> require `dedupe: true` + `replayStorePath` + `acknowledgeSingleInstance` and the
> gate refuses them in multi-replica (`dedupe: false`) mode. `replayStorePath` must
> be **local disk**; a shared/network filesystem across hosts defeats the lock.

> **A capability is a PRE-PAID reuse window at the price paid.** It grants reuse
> for `receiptScopeSeconds` from the settling payment, and a later `priceUsdc` change
> does **not** retroactively re-price or revoke an outstanding capability (the buyer
> already paid for that term). Set `receiptScopeSeconds` to the longest window you're
> willing to pre-sell at the current price — that is your exposure bound.

## Install safety

This skill runs where your seller wallet lives. **Install so no transitive native
addon can run install-time code on that host** — use either:

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts @parad0x_labs/openclaw-x402-gate   # skips ALL install scripts
npm install --omit=optional  @parad0x_labs/openclaw-x402-gate   # skips the optional native addons
```

This is **required, not optional** for a key-holding host. The only transitive
native builds are `bufferutil` / `utf-8-validate` — **optional** perf addons of
`@solana/web3.js`'s WebSocket stack; this skill makes only HTTP RPC calls, so they
are never loaded, and skipping them loses nothing.

> **npm cannot enforce this from inside a published package** — a dependency's
> `overrides`/`scripts`/`.npmrc` don't govern your install, only your root project's
> do. Treat `--ignore-scripts` as policy on any wallet host, and prefer building on
> a host that does not hold the seller key.

## Flow

1. Caller hits your gated capability with no payment → `x402_challenge` returns a
   402 telling them the price and your address.
2. Caller pays (e.g. via `openclaw-x402-pay`) and retries with an `X-Payment`
   header.
3. `x402_verify` checks it. With `requireOnChain`, it confirms the transaction
   settled before you serve the resource.

## Operations

- **Rate-limit `x402_verify`.** With `requireOnChain`, each call may cost one
  `getTransaction` on your metered RPC. Presenter-auth limits callers to keypair
  holders (each attempt costs them a signature) but does not rate-limit — put a
  per-source / per-payer limit in front of the endpoint so an unpaid caller can't
  run up your RPC bill.
- **Run one instance per `replayStorePath`.** The file replay store is
  single-writer; the gate refuses to start if another live process holds the lock.
  For multiple replicas, use `dedupe=false` + your own shared store (Redis/DB) and
  set `acknowledgeExternalReplayStore=true`.

## No external @parad0x_labs dependency

Constants and wire types are vendored inline. The runtime dependencies are
`@solana/web3.js` (on-chain confirmation), `bs58` (decoding the SPL Memo instruction
for program-attested receipt binding), `typebox` (tool parameter schemas), and
`snarkjs` + `poseidon-lite` (track-record proof verification).
